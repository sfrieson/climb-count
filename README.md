> **ðŸ¤– AI-Generated Application**: This entire climbing progress tracker was generated by Claude AI, showcasing modern web development practices and clean MVC architecture.

A climbing progress tracking application built with vanilla JavaScript following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern.

## Architecture

The application is now organized using the MVC pattern for better separation of concerns:

### Model (`models/ClimbModel.js`)
- **Responsibility**: Data management and business logic
- **Features**:
  - Session and attempt data management
  - localStorage integration for persistence
  - Statistics calculations
  - Data validation

### View (`views/ClimbView.js`)
- **Responsibility**: DOM manipulation and rendering
- **Features**:
  - Session and statistics rendering
  - Form management
  - Chart visualization
  - UI state management

### Controller (`controllers/ClimbController.js`)
- **Responsibility**: User interactions and application flow
- **Features**:
  - Event handling
  - Coordinating between Model and View
  - User input processing
  - Navigation management

### Main Application (`app.js`)
- **Responsibility**: Application initialization and global function exports
- **Features**:
  - MVC component instantiation
  - Global function wrappers for HTML onclick handlers

## Benefits of MVC Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to one component minimally impact others
3. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
4. **Reusability**: Components can be reused or replaced more easily
5. **Scalability**: New features can be added without major refactoring

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser to start using the application. All functionality remains the same as before, but the code is now better organized and more maintainable.
